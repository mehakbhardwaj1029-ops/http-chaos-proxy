Till now there is no such chaos coming down to our proxy ,

So now, we'll be making the proxy come to a decision i.e; should this request behave normally or should we break in on purpose?

This is done to introduce this chaos in reverse proxy which will allow any service or api to test their resiliency.

Some Chaos Rules that we'll be implementing:

1. for /health - do nothing
2. for /echo - add 500ms delay
3. for /headers - fail 20% of requests

So basically your request path will be compared with these chaos engine rules and randomly reverse proxy will intentionally delay or fail your request
